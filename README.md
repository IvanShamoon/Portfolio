# [Anime or  Adult Anime?](https://github.com/IvanShamoon/Testubg/blob/main/job_scrap.ipynb)

This is a personal project inspired by course work to use text processing and machine learning. It is influenced by the binary comparison of spam and ham, and engages with an area many are interested in. 

## Project Objective

This project deploys a variety of text processing and machine learning tools to investigate whether there's any differences between the summaries of Anime and Adult Anime. The main intention was of personal development in terms of data. However, there is no doubt an interest of the differences between these two bodies of work. Do certain genres engages more with wordplay than the other genre? Do certain words populate a genre more than the others? These questions are the main tenents of this project.

## Methods Used
* Web Scraping (BeautifulSoup)
* Data Cleaning
* Text processing
* Machine learning classifiers
